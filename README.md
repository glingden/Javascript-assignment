# Advanced Javascript assignments

## Assignment 1

Write Javascript code that prints out (using `console.log`) a sequence of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 (one million) without blocking the interactions with the browser. For example, while that piece of Javascript is running, mouse, keyboard events etc should work fine and browser doesn't hang.

- Note that if the implementation wrong, while running that code, your CPU usage may reach over 90%
- Be careful that you may make browser hang while testing. You can quickly close the tab that's running the code to stop it

Write your code in `assignment-1.js` file.

## Assignment 2

Write an ES6 class that does the following:

- A method to get list of all countries
- A method that accept a country name as input and search for that country, either by international or native name (such as Finland or Suomi, the API has endpoint for this)
- A method that accepts a country name, find out what other countries it's bordering with
- A method that accepts the code (2 characters) of a language, find out what countries are speaking it (the API has endpoint for this)
- A method that accepts a population number (in millions), find out what countries have more people than that

Countries APIs can be found here: [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/)

Write your code in `assignment-2.js` file.
Hint: You have to use a combination of fetch to get the country array, then use the array methods like `map`, `filter` to get what you want
